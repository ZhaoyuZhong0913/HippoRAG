Where are you now ? Who lies beneath your spell_ ? '' he sang in a passionate , vibrating baritone . He was singing in English , and yet the almost indefinite slurring from note to note was strangely un-English ."

The voice seemed to come from the dark shadows at the end of the garden , or it might have been further away out in the road beyond the cactus hedge .

She came out of the tent and stood a moment exchanging an amused smile with Stephens , who was hovering near dubiously , one eye on her and the other on his master . She was late , and Sir Aubrey liked his meals punctually . The baronet was lounging in one deck-chair with his feet on another . Diana wagged an admonishing forefinger . `` Fly , Stephens , and fetch the soup ! If it is cold there will be a riot . ''"

She drew a long breath . It was the desert at last , the desert that she felt she had been longing for all her life . She had never known until this moment how intense the longing had been ."

It was a large caravan ; the bales on the camels ' backs looked heavy , and beside the merchants on riding camels and a motley crowd of followers -- some on lean little donkeys and others on foot -- there was an armed guard of mounted men . It took some time to pass ."

Perhaps she was hungry , perhaps she was tired , or perhaps she was only annoyed by the bad arrangements of her guide , but before the advent of the mounted Arabs Diana had been conscious of a feeling of oppression , as if the silent desolation of the desert was weighing heavily upon her , but the body of swiftly moving men and horses had changed the aspect utterly . An atmosphere of life and purpose seemed to have taken the place of the quiet stagnation that had been before their coming . The distance between the two parties decreased rapidly ."

Diana 's eyes passed over him slowly till they rested on his brown , clean-shaven face , surmounted by crisp , close-cut brown hair . It was the handsomest and cruellest face that she had ever seen .

From the few scribbled words in the front of each Diana could see that they had all been sent to the Arab by the author himself -- one even was dedicated to '' My friend , Ahmed Ben Hassan , Sheik of the Desert . '' She put the books back with a puzzled frown . She wished , with a feeling that she could not fathom , that they had been rather what she had imagined . The evidence of education and unlooked-for tastes in the man they belonged to troubled her ."

She had suffered so much that nothing more mattered .

With a choking cry she leaped to her feet suddenly and fled from him , back till the side of the tent stopped her and she stood , with wide-flung arms , gripping the black and silver hangings until he reached her . Stooping he disengaged her clinging fingers from the heavy drapery and drew her hands slowly together up to his breast with a little smile ."

There were times when she forgot altogether that he was an Arab until some chance , as now , drove the hard fact home indisputably .

But with a reckless laugh she snapped the thin case to , and carefully scraped the evil-smelling sulphur match torn from a flat wood strip . She settled herself comfortably again full length ."

For a few minutes a sand spider attracted her attention and she watched his hurried painstaking operations with wondering interest . Gradually a drowsy feeling stole over her and she realised suddenly that the air was impregnated with the scent of the tobacco that was always associated with the Sheik . It was one of his cigarettes that she was smoking ."

The men were riding in unusual silence , though a low exclamation or the subdued jingle of accoutrements was heard occasionally , once some one fired at a night creature that bounded out from almost under his horse 's feet ."

He was peering intently ahead , his eyes flashing in the cold light , his brows drawn together in the characteristic heavy scowl , and the firm chin , so near her face , was pushed out more doggedly than usual . He felt her move and glanced down ."

But she had schooled herself to hide her love , to yield apathetically to his caresses , and to conceal the longing that possessed her . She was afraid that the knowledge that she loved him would bring about the disaster she dreaded . The words that he had once used remained continually in her mind : `` If you loved me you would bore me , and I should have to let you go . '' And she hid her love closely in her heart ."

She had felt a momentary embarrassment before she left the tent , thinking of the last time he had ridden with her , but she had known from the moment he came back that night that he bore no malice , and the look on his face and his stammered words to the Sheik had indicated that the fear he felt for her was not for what might have happened in the desert , but for what might yet happen to her at the hands of his master and hers ."

He was difficult to mount , and edged away shyly as Diana tried to get her foot into the stirrup . But she swung up at last , and by the time The Dancer had finished his display of _haute ecole_ Gaston was mounted . `` After riding The Dancer I feel confident to enter for the _Concours Hippique_ , '' she laughed over her shoulder , and touched the horse with her heel ."

She did not see the necessity for them . She had never been aware of anything any time when she was riding that seemed to justify the Sheik 's order . The oasis was not on a caravan route , and if she ever saw Arabs at any distance from the camp they always proved to be Ahmed Ben Hassan 's own men ."

For a moment the Vicomte hesitated , but he knew that not even he was wanted inside that empty tent , and a half-bitter , half-sad feeling that the perfect friendship and confidence that had existed between them for twenty years would never again be the same came to them , the regretful sense of inevitable change , the consciousness of personal relegation ."

Diana hated the sweet , thick stuff , but it would do until she could get the water she wanted , and she put out her hand to take the little cup .

What beyond the woman 's expression made her think so she did not know , but she was sure of it . She put the cup aside impatiently . `` No . Not coffee ."

She could hear the horrible meaning he had put into the words , she could see the terrible smile that had accompanied them . Her breath came faster , but her courage still held . She clung desperately to the hope that was sustaining her ."

He made no more remonstrances , but set about his work quickly . And all through the horrible time that followed she did not falter . Her face was deadly pale , and dark lines showed below her eyes , but her hands did not shake , and her voice was low and even . She suffered horribly .

From the day he learned the truth about himself for two years we saw nothing of him . Then the old Sheik asked us to visit him .

He had slept in the outer room since his illness , and tossing feverishly on the soft cushions of the big empty bed in which she lay alone Diana had suffered the greatest humiliation she had yet experienced . He had never loved her , but now he did not even want her . She was useless to him ."

In her fitful sleep her dreams were agonies from which she awakened with shaking limbs and shuddering breath , and waking , her hand would stretch out groping to him till remembrance came with cruel vividness ."

At last Raoul had announced that his visit could be protracted no longer and that he must resume his journey to Morocco . He was going up to Oran and from there to Tangier by coasting steamer , collecting at Tangier a caravan for his expedition through Morocco ."

Would it be given to her ever to watch them again sparkling against the blue-blackness of the sky , with the curve of his arm round her and the steady beat of his heart under her cheek ? A stab of pain went : through her . Would anything ever be the same again ?"

All this was nearly within his reach . Let only Dain return !"

He was very soon made to understand that he was not wanted in that corner of it where old Lingard and his own weak will placed him , in the midst of unscrupulous intrigues and of a fierce trade competition ."

Almayer suspected some attempt at a swindle , or at any rate something unpleasant , but of course consented with a great show of rejoicing . Accordingly the next evening , after sunset , Abdulla came , accompanied by several other grey-beards and by his nephew . That young man -- of a very rakish and dissipated appearance -- affected the greatest indifference as to the whole of the proceedings ."

That 's why he had ordered her , with that quiet masterfulness it was her delight to obey , to meet him at break of day in Bulangi 's creek . Was there a paddle in her canoe ? she thought . Was it ready ? She would have to start early -- at four in the morning , in a very few hours ."

From the safe position of a confidential adviser , he could , in the dim vista of past years , see himself -- a casual cut-throat -- finding shelter under that man 's roof in the modest rice-clearing of early beginnings . Then came a long period of unbroken success , of wise counsels , and deep plottings resolutely carried out by the fearless Lakamba , till the whole east coast from Poulo Laut to Tanjong Batu listened to Babalatchi 's wisdom speaking through the mouth of the ruler of Sambir ."

Dreamily he assured himself over and over again that she would come , till the certitude crept into his heart and filled him with a great peace .

A chorus of loud roars and plaintive calls rose from the mud along the line of bushes . He laughed heartily ; doubtless it was their love-song . He felt affectionate towards the frogs and listened , pleased with the noisy life near him . When the moon peeped above the trees he felt the old impatience and the old restlessness steal over him . Why was she so late ? True , it was a long way to come with a single paddle ."

She , not hearing a responsive word , not feeling a touch , opened her eyes -- saw her father , and sat up suddenly with a movement of terror . `` Oh , father ! '' she murmured faintly , and in that word there was expressed regret and fear and dawning hope . `` I shall never forgive you , Nina , '' said Almayer , in a dispassionate voice . `` You have torn my heart from me while I dreamt of your happiness . You have deceived me . Your eyes that for me were like truth itself lied to me in every glance -- for how long ?"

The revolving office chair stood in its place , but he found the pivot set fast when he tried to turn it . No matter ."

Close under them the water lapped the piles , agitated by the evolutions of a little white steamboat trellised with coloured globes which was to run passengers up and down the Lake . It was already black with them as it sheered off on its first trip . Suddenly Charity heard a woman 's laugh behind her . The sound was familiar , and she turned to look ."

Miss Hatchard , pale with fatigue and excitement , thanked her young assistants , and stood in the porch , leaning on her crutches and waving a farewell as she watched them troop away down the street . Charity had slipped off among the first ; but at the gate she heard Ally Hawes calling after her , and reluctantly turned . `` Will you come over now and try on your dress ? '' Ally asked , looking at her with wistful admiration ."

It gave her strength , after a moment , to walk on slowly in the direction of the post office , and go in through the swinging doors ."
